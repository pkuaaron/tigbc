  TIGBC was established in response to the need for a Chinese church in the Ballantyne area of Charlotte, wherein thousands of Chinese live who need to hear the truth of God’s grace and meet and grow together with other believers. Our mission is to share the gospel to lead people to Christ, teach Scriptural truth to build the church body up into mature Christian life, seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit to serve each other, and glorify God in humility and service to Him.

<font size="3" face="Calibri">
1.	We believe that the whole Bible is God’s complete inspiration, that it was inerrantly written by divinely inspired men, that it alone is of supreme, infallible and final authority in all matters of faith and life, and is true in all that it affirms.</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Psalm 19:7-9; Proverbs 30:5-6; Isaiah 40:8; Matthew 5:18; 1 Corinthians 2:13; 10:11; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:21.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
2.	We believe that God is the creator of heaven and earth, and is Spirit, light, life, love, and truth. We believe God is all knowing, all powerful, eternal, ever present, infallible and unchangeable, that He is infinitely wise, holy, righteous, faithful, merciful and loving, and that He sovereignly upholds, sustains and governs all things, in order to bring about His good, pleasing, and perfect will. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Genesis 1:1; Exodus 34:6-7; Deuteronomy 32:4; 33:27; Psalm 33:11; 62:11; 86:15; 90:2; 102:12, 24-27; 104:24; 115:2-3; 117:2; 139:7-10; 145:3; 147:5; Isaiah 14:24; 40:26, 48:12-13; Jeremiah 23:24, 32:17; Malachi 3:6; Matthew 10:29-30, 19:26; John 1:4; 4:24; 14:6; Romans 3:26; 11:33-36; Ephesians 1:11-12; Colossians 1:16-17; 1 Timothy 6:15-16; Hebrews 1:2-3, 12; 4:13; 6:17-18; 13:8; James 1:17; 1 Peter 1:15-16; 1 John 3:3, 5, 20; 4:8; Revelation 1:4, 8; 15:4.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
3.	We believe there is only one living and true God, who exists eternally in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe that these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Genesis 1:26; Deuteronomy 6:4; Psalm 96:4-5; Isaiah 43:10-11; 44:6; 45:21-22; 46:9; 48:16; Jeremiah 10:10; Matthew 3:16-17; 16:16; 28:19; John 1:1; 10:30; 14:9-11; 15:26; 17:3, 5; Acts 5:3-4; Romans 9:5; 1 Corinthians 8:4-6; 2 Corinthians 3:17; 13:14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:2,3; 1 Peter 1:2; 1 John 5:20; Jude 24-25.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
4.	We believe that God the Father is the eternal Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; that He is invisible and is only made known through His Son. We believe that He called those whom He elected before the foundation of the world to be adopted as His children in Jesus Christ, and sent His only Son to the world so that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(John 1:1-2, 12, 18; 3:16; 10:30; 14:9-11; 17:3, 5; Romans 8:29-30; Gal 3:26; Ephesians 1:3-10; 1 John 3:1.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
5.	We believe in Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God and the eternal Word manifested in flesh. We believe that He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, and that He was, when He was on earth, fully God and fully man without sin. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Isaiah 7:14; 9:6; John 1:1-2,14,18; Luke 1:30-35; Romans 9:5; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-8; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
6.	We believe that the Holy Spirit, being the third person of the God-head, is ever present to glorify and testify of Jesus Christ. He convicts men of sin, teaches truth, and regenerates, indwells, baptizes, and seals believers and enables them live a holy life. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(John 3:5-6; 14:16-26; 15:26; 16:7-15; Acts 1:8; 5:3-4; Romans 8:9-11; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:19; 12:4-13; Galatians 5:22-23; Ephesians 1:13-14; 4:30; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:1-2.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
7.	We believe man was created in the image of God, but sinned against God, incurring death and alienation from God to all men throughout all generations. Man has no possible means of reconciling himself to God, and by persisting in the sinful state of unbelief, man is justly condemned by God to eternal punishment.</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Genesis 1:26-27; 2:17; 3:6; Isaiah 53:6a; 64:6; Jeremiah 17:9; Mark 7:20-23; John 3:18; Romans 5:12-14; 1 Corinthians 15:22a; Ephesians 2:1-3.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
8.	We believe that only through personal faith alone in the atoning work of Jesus Christ, man is reconciled to God by grace and justified on the grounds of His shed blood. Being reconciled, man has peace with God and direct access to Him through Jesus Christ, and has the hope of eternal glory in Heaven with God. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Genesis 15:6; Habakkuk 2:4; John 1:12-13, 29; 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:25-26, 28; Ephesians 1:7; 2 Corinthians 5:14; 1 Timothy 2:5; Titus 3:5; Hebrews 9:11-28; 10:5-19; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18; 1 John 1:7.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
9.	We believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins, and that all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood and therefore forgiven of their sins and reconciled to God. </font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(John 1:29; Romans 3:25-26; 2 Corinthians 5:14; Hebrews 10:5-19; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18; 1 John 1:7.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
10.	We believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and ascended to Heaven, and is, as our High Priest, the only intercessor and advocate between us and God the Father.
</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Matthew 28:5-7; Luke 24:5-7, 36-46; John 14:6; 21:14; Acts 1:1-11; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:20; 1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 8:1, 6; 9:24.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
11.	We believe that Jesus Christ will return in glory to save the just and judge the wicked, and to reign over His kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Matthew 24:30-31; John 14:1-3; Philippians 3:20; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 2:8-10; Titus 2:13.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
12.	We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust. We believe in the everlasting blessedness of the saved and the everlasting conscious punishment of the lost.
</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Matthew 25:41; John 5:24, 28, 29; 1 Corinthians 15:20-28, 50-54; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; 4:14-17; Revelation 20:11-15.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
13.	We believe that Christ instituted the ordinances of water baptism and the Lord's Supper as holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace, and commanded them to be observed by believers until He returns.
</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Matthew 26:26-29; Matthew 28:19-20; Luke 22:19-20; Acts 2:41-42; Acts 8:36-39; Romans 6:3-5; 1 Corinthians 11:23-34.)
</font><br><br><font size="3" face="Calibri">
14.	We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ builds His Church to be the pillar and foundation of God’s truth, by calling those to be redeemed and sanctified by His blood through faith. These are united to Him in one body, with Christ Himself as the Head. We believe that the Church universal is to manifest itself in local assemblies, where believers of Christ gather together in corporate worship, participating in ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, building up each other’s faith, holding each other accountable to the obedience that comes through faith, caring for the poor and needy, and spreading the Gospel to the ends of the earth, all for the glory of God.
</font><br><font size="2" face="Calibri">
(Matthew 16:16-18; 28:18-20; John 4:23-24; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 5:11-13; 11:23-26; 14:26;  Ephesians 1:7, 22-23; 4:11-13; 5:18-20, 23; Colossians 1:18, 24; 3:15-17; 1 Timothy 3:15; Titus 2:14; Hebrews 3:12-13; James 5:19-20; 1 Peter 1:2; Jude 20-23.)
