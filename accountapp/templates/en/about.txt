The name of Truth in Grace Bible Church comes from John 1:14, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us…full of grace and truth," and John 1:17, "…grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. " Jesus said, "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10)." This way of life through God’s abundant grace comes through the teaching and guidance of biblical truth and by the renewing power of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, which helps us live out this abundant life that transcends ourselves.
Through God’s promise, abundant loving kindness, and mercy, TIGBC was established in the South Charlotte/Ballantyne area, as we followed in pure faith every step of the way after God’s calling, according to His will.
TIGBC focuses on the transformation of Christian lives according to the teaching of Scripture, relying on the manifestation of Jesus Christ’s life within us as our motivation to live lives for Him. Through Christ, we aim to serve each other, implore others to be reconciled with God, impact one another’s lives through Christ’s life in us, and restore God centered, Biblically principled relationships to glorify God individually and collectively, in each family and in the community.
